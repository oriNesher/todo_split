  <h1>Privacy Policy for SplitIt</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SplitIt helps users manage their tasks by breaking them into smaller, more achievable steps.
    We value your privacy and designed this app so your data stays on your device only.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    All data you enter in the app (tasks, notes, statistics, etc.) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    SplitIt does not collect any personal data, analytics, or usage statistics.
    We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Backups</h2>
  <p>
    If your device or Google account performs automatic backups, your app data may be included in those backups.
    These backups are managed solely by your device or Google account and not by us.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    SplitIt currently does not use any third-party services. If future versions integrate analytics,
    crash reports, or ads, we will update this policy to reflect those changes.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app. This permanently removes all locally stored information.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
